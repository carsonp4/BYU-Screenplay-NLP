# Screenplay-NLP

This repository contains the code used for my final project in my natural langauge processing class at BYU.

Abstract from the project:

This paper introduces the potential for using a transformer model in evaluating film characteristics and predicting film success based solely on a screenplay. This analysis aims to aid screenwriters to potentially provide evidence that a screenplay can be successful if given the opportunity to be produced. Using a dataset of 1130 screenplays, twelve classification models were built, each designed to predict a specific attribute such as parental advisory ratings, audience reception, and box-office success. Each model was fine-tuned using the DistilBERT base uncased model and was evaluated using accuracy. While some characteristics, such as parental ratings and film era, show moderate predictive success, others, like runtime and season, perform marginally better than random guessing. Still, the probabilities outputted from the models provide insight into the expectations of success for a screenplay. This paper concludes that further research using larger transformer models and computation with a larger dataset could lead to more accurate results.
